1. Dealing with floppy disks!!! 

Note: In the following examples is assumed that your usb floopy drive has been detected as: /dev/sdd

How to format a floppy disk in a non-standard capacity in ubuntu.

To format a 3.5 inch floppy disk in msdos 720k format in a usb floppy drive connected to your ubuntu system type:
> sudo ufiformat -f 720 -v /dev/sdd
> sudo mkdosfs -I /dev/sdd

Then you can mount the floppy, and test if it works by:

> sudo mount /dev/sdd /mnt
> ls /mnt

Don't forget to unmount when finished with:
> sudo umount /mnt

How to write an existing image file to your usb connected floppy in ubuntu:

> sudo dd if=diskimage.img of=/dev/sdd


2. Write to a disk via an image file.

a) create a blank image file with capacity 720k:
> mkfs.msdos -C imagefile.img 720

b) mount the image file to the filesystem.
> sudo mount -o loop imagefile.img /mnt

c) copy the files to the mounted image
> sudo cp * /mnt

d) unmount the image file:
> sudo umount /mnt

e) format the floppy disk with:
> sudo ufiformat -f 720 -v /dev/sdd
Note: if the floppy diskette refuses to format, use a piece of tape to cover the HD hole that is in the plastic cover of the diskette.

f) write the image file to the floppy disk.
> sudo dd bs=512 of=/dev/sdd if=imagefile.img
