1. Repair Sata Hard disk 3.5'' with broken controller.
Make:
Samsung 
  400 GB
Symptoms:
- Click of death, wouldn't be identified in the PC.
- Afterwards it stopped spinning completely, because of surcharge in the power supply (by mistake) which blew up the fuse and the diode in the PCB.

Checking:
- checked with polymeter:
1. The sata power connector for short circuit in the 5 and 2 volt lines
2. The TVS diodes or 5V and 12V lines.
Diode and fuse identified in the PCB and are shown in the picture marked in red oval and blue oval respectivelly in the attached photos.

Diagnosis result:
1. TVS diode (it has a marking QE in its body) found broken.
2. Fuse for 5 vold line (it has a marking 0 in its body) found broken.

Repair:
- Removed the TVS diode used for protecting the 5 volts line (it has a marking QE in its body, see picture), after the conductivity test
and found to to provide conductivity in both ways.
- The fuse (it has a marking 0 in its body, see picture) was removed as it failed to provide conductivity at all.
