1. Repair Sata Hard disk 3.5'' with broken controller.
Make:
Samsung 
  400 GB
Symptoms:
- Click of death, wouldn't be identified in the PC.
- Afterwards it stopped spinning completely, because of surcharge in the power supply (by mistake) which blew up the fuse and the diode in the PCB.

Checking:
- checked with polymeter:
1. The sata power connector for short circuit in the 5 and 2 volt lines
2. The TVs diodes or 5V and 12V lines.
Diode and fuse identified in the PCB and are shown in the picture marked in red oval and blue oval respectivelly in the attached photos.

Diagnosis result:
1. 
2.

Repair:
- Removed the TVS diode used for protecting the 5 volts line (it has a marking QE in the PCB, see picture), after it was checked for conductivity and found failed as it provided conductivity 
in both ways.
