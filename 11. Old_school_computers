1. Dealing with floppy disks!!! 

How to format a floppy disk in a non-standard capacity in ubuntu.

To format a 3.5 inch floppy disk in msdos 720k format in a usb floppy drive connected to your ubuntu system type:
> sudo ufiformat -f 720 -v /dev/sdd
> sudo mkdosfs -I /dev/sdd

Then you can mount the floppy, and test if it works by:

> sudo mount /dev/sdd /mnt
> ls /mnt

Don't forget to unmount with:
> sudo umount /mnt
