Co-lab [1] is a new service by Google which provides access to Google's GPU computing power to anyone who has a google 
user account. Such service is quite useful for tasks like Neural Network training, where nvidia GPUs has become the 
industry standard.

The traditional way (or the one suggested by google) to access these resources is via the use of python notebook 
interfaces [2]. Notebook contents can have the form of: text, code, output, or comments.

Pyhton is the standard suppored language for coding within Google colab, which can also be mixed with unix shell commands.
The code runs in OS virtualization environments known as: containers. They become very popular as they provide the isolation, 
and the security of a sandbox environemnt which makes it suitable for executing not-trusted code in compouting environments.
Working within containers though, in comparison to using real computers, has the major drawback of the state
of the environment not been preserved (e.g. processes, disk contents) after the container has been terminated.

To run this tutorial you need to have access to the following:
1. Google Colab account
2. Account on ngrok service.
3. Unix shell in your local machine.
