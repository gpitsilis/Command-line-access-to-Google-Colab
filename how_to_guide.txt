Co-lab [1] is a new service by Goolle which provides access to GPU computing power to anyone who has a google user account.
Such service is quite useful for tasks like Neural Network training, where nvidia GPUs has become the industry standard.

The traditional way (or the one suggested by google) to access these resources is via the use of python notebook interfaces [2]. Notebook contents can have the form of: text, code, output, or comments.

Pyhton is the standard language to use for coding in google colab, which can be mixed with unix shell commands.
The code runs in OS virtualization environments known as: containers. They become very popular as they provide isolation, 
and security in code execution..... not trusted code.
Working within containers, in comparison to using real computers, has though the major drawback of not preserving the state
of the environment (e.g. processes, disk contents) after the container has been terminated.
