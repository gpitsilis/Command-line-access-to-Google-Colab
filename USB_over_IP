While it is not the best way to access remotelly a printer in a local network (there are alternatives for sharing teh printer, such as CUPS), 
this technique is ideal for sharing scanner devices over IP.

Steps:

1. Install usbip on the machine which the usb device is attached to. (server)

2. Install usbip on the workstation machine we wish to access the usb device deviremotely. (client)

3. On the server machine, open a unix shell window and type the following commands:

This is for checking that the usb device is accessible by the operating system.
# sudo modprobe vhci-hcd

This is for ...
# lsmod | grep vhci_hcd

This is for listing the identifiers given to usb devices by usbip 
#sudo usbip list -l

# This is for binding a device using an identifier already listed with the previous command (1-1 is used as example here)
sudo usbip bind --busid 1-1

4. On the client side, open a unix shell window and type the following commands:

This is for listing the identifiers of the usb devices bound in the server machine (192.168.1.216 is used as an example server IP here) 
we wish to access a usb device.
# sudo usbip list -r 192.168.1.216

This is for attaching a listed remote device to the local list of usb devices (1-1 is used as an example here, as well as the remote IP: 192.168.1.216) 
# sudo usbip attach -r 192.168.1.216 -d 1-1

Check if the remote usb device is shown in the list of the local ones.
# lsusb

5. You are now ready to use the remote usb device as if it wsas a local one.
