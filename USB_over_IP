This tutorial is for sharing USB devices over network in Linux.

The information we provide can be used in linux machines only (ubuntu, debian etc)

While it is not the best way to access remotelly a printer in a local network (there are alternatives for sharing teh printer, such as CUPS), 
this technique is ideal for sharing scanner devices over IP.

The tool we used for achieving this is called "Usb redirector for Linux" and it can be found at:

It contains a client and a server component that you need to install each one in your machines (local and remote)

After you install the server and the client components in the machines to share and access the USB device respectivelly, do the following:

1. On the remote side:
check if usb device you wish to share is connected to the server machine
# usbls

# usbsrv -info
# usbsrv -auto-share on
# usbsrv -list-devices
# usbsrv -share 1

2. On the local side:
OXI
# usbclnt -connect -server <server IP>:<server port>
example:
OXI
# usbclnt -connect -server 192.168.1.216:32032

3. On the local side:
# usbclnt -add-server <server IP>:<ervice port>
exampe:
# usbclnt -add-server 192.168.1.216:32032

to take a list of the remote USB devices:
# usbclnt -l

to connect to one of the remote USB devices:
# usbclnt -connect 1-1

check if the device appears in the list of local usb devices
# lsusb

to disconnect from a remote USB device:
# usbclnt -disconnect 1-1

4. On the remote side
