How to expose your services (web sites, IoT devices etc) which are hosted on you local network,
so that they become accessible via the internet under a fixed domain name, 
at no cost !

This tutorial is suited for anyone who is experimenting and testing with own services, before their exposure for commercial use.
It is also useful for anyone who wishes to make his local machine or IoT device in general 
publically accessible from anywhere. Such devices or hosts are usually hidden behind a NAT and have private IP addresses.

General assumptions:

1. Your local machine is NATed ( networked behind a gateway/firewall, and it has private IP address of type 192.168.x.x )
2. You are not happy to pay the costs for a domain name registration.
3. You are not willing to spend money for renting a Server Hardware or a Virtual Private Server.
4. There is available hardware in your local network, capable of running your services that is to expose.


The ingredients:

1. ngrok service. A tunneling service used for exposing your local service to the public, making them endpoing urls.
2. dynu service. A DNS service which provides subdomain names of your choice free of charge.
3. Apache http server, running in your local device. This is the main service you are interested in making public.


Steps.

1. Download and install ngrok in your local device.
