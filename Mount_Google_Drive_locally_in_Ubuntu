This is how to mount your google-drive in ubuntu and make it look like a local drive/directory

1. Install rclone

Find and download rclone.

check instructions at:
https://snapcraft.io/install/rclone/ubuntu

Proceed, either via:

a) > sudo snap install rclone

b) > sudo apt install rclone

2. Setup rclone

type:

> rclone config

Follow the prompts and setup for google drive (it is the option 7, I think)


3. Test rclone connectivity with google-drive

Check if remote listing of files can be produced, by:

> rclone gdrive:

If you get a list of files, it means that rclone has been setup properly

4. Mount the goodle drive under a local directory.

> mkdir ~./googledrive

> rclone mount gdrive: ~./googledrive

> ls googledrive

voila !
